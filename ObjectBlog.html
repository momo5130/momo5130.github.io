    <h1>Objects and its internal Representation in JavaScript</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending on their types).</p>
    <p>Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.</p>
    <p>An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.</p>
    <p>Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>
    <p>An object can be created with figure brackets {…} with an optional list of properties. A property is a “key: value” pair, where a key is a string (also called a “property name”), and value can be anything.</p>
    <p>To understand this rather abstract definition, let us look at an example of a JavaScript Object :</p>
    <em>let college = {<br>
        name : “SASTRA University”,<br>
        city : “Thanjavur”,<br>
        state : “Tamil Nadu”<br>
        }
    </em>
    <p>In the above example “name”, “city”, “state” are all “keys” and “SASTRA University”, “Thanjavur” and “Tamil Nadu” are values of these keys respectively.</p>
    <h2>We can create objects in many ways in javascript, let’s look at each one of them.</h2>
    <h3>1.Object literal (Direct way) :- </h3>
    <p>Object literals are a comma-separated list of key-value pairs wrapped in curly braces. Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, nested object literals or primitive data type.</p>   
    <em>var student = {<br>
        id: 1,<br>
        name: "Monika",<br>
        age: “23”,<br>
        updateAddress: () => {<br>
        // logic to update address<br>
        },<br>
        grade: [‘A’, ‘A+’, ‘A’]<br>
        }
    </em>
    <h5>(The student object keys in the above can be accessed via Dot notation i.e student.id, student.name or via a square bracket notation i.e student[‘id’], student[‘name’], etc)</h5>
    <p>There are other methods as well with which an object can be created in Javascript, but out of all, object literal method is the most effective.</p>    
    <h4>Literal notation takes less space in the source code. It’s clearly recognizable as to what is happening, so using new Object(), you are really just typing more and (in theory, if not optimized out by the JavaScript engine) doing an unnecessary function call. Also, literal notation creates the object and assigns the property in same line of code which is not the case with others.</h4>
